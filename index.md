# whoami?

No one really. I'm a 19 year old soon to be 20, planning on majoring in Applied Mathematics and Computing. I enjoy learning and using what I've learned creatively to make things. Sometimes they work, most times they don't, yet the satisfaction I get from them is the same.

## **What will I be posting about?**

I'll be sharing many things on this blog, it might be a simple program in which I've delved into a topic of interest to me, an elegant proof that I found, something cool that I learned how to do, a song, an artwork, a thought or an idea that went through my head. As long as I find joy in studying, writing about it and explaining it, you will most probably find it on here.

The topics I'm interested in are: 

- Programming
- Mathematics(Number Theory and Cryptography) 
- Computer Science 
- Linguistics 
- Philosophy 
- History
- Literature(SF and Fantasy)
- Music(Funk, Jazz, Rock, Metal, Classical, R&B, Soul, Blues, Fusion,...)

I'm basically a hundred percent sure I'm missing something, yet I guess we'll figure out what while you're reading the blog post about it.

## **Why am I writing a blog?**

I guess that's the easiest to answer, many times while looking to learn something, I've found the information, dull; the exposition, lacking and the explanation, less than ideal. My hope is that I can put a new spin in my explanation of some topics, as well as rendering the content more fun and a bit easier to swallow. I will be posting what I'm learning, creating and discovering in the hopes that I'll understand it better, which in turn will help you understand it as well. 

There are **two** things you can be sure of;

1. I'm not trying to monetize anything, as such you can rest assured that my opinions are entirely my own, and no one else's.
2. I don't use b.s jargon. If you want to feel important, refer to [this](https://www.atrixnet.com/bs-generator.html).

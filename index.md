# whoami?

No one really. I'm a 19 year old soon to be 20, planning on majoring in Applied Mathematics and Computing. I'm open minded, enjoy learning and most importantly enjoy using what I've learned creatively to make things that give me a sort of satisfaction.

## **What will I be posting about?**

I'll be sharing many things on this blog, it might be a simple program in which I've delved into a topic of interest to me, an elegant proof that I found or came up with(doubt), something cool I learned how to do, or a song, artwork, thought and idea that went through my head.

The topics I'm interested in are: 

- Programming
- Mathematics(Number Theory and Cryptography) 
- Computer Science 
- Linguistics 
- Philosophy 
- History
- Literature(SF and Fantasy)
- Music(Funk, Jazz, Rock, Metal, Classical, R&B, Soul, Blues, Fusion,...)

I'm basically a hundred percent sure I'm missing something, yet I guess we'll figure out what while you're reading the blog post about it.

## **Why am I writing a blog?**

I guess that's the easiest to answer, many times while looking to learn something, I've found the information, dull; the exposition, lacking and the explanation, less than ideal. This will be my remedy to that. I will be posting what I'm learning, creating and discovering in the hopes that I'll understand it better; and that you might have a respite from the dullness of the countless internet "guru's", "coders", "developers", and all others who seem to want to impart on you useless, repetitive and subpar information in the effort that they will get you to buy some of their equally garbage products. 

None of that exists on this blog, I'm not really looking towards monetizing it, let alone selling you something. And that comes from the fact that I'm ultimately doing this for myself, in the hopes that I can document my journey throughout my interests.
